# Federate the Masses
A modular, local-first framework for building federated web applications.

Federate the Masses is an experimental toolkit for developers building decentralized apps where users retain control of their data. Inspired by tools like PocketBase, this framework simplifies federation — enabling secure, server-to-server sync with a local-first approach and a clean API surface.

## ✨ Features
Local-first architecture
Data lives locally, syncing only when necessary — resilient and offline-friendly.

Federated sync engine
Built-in support for secure server-to-server data synchronization using shared records and access tokens.

Schema-driven design
Define collections, relations, and behavior declaratively.

API-centric architecture
Clean, documented APIs allow integration without tight coupling — ideal for modular plugin or external use.

Composable and extensible
Build apps with federated logic from day one or layer it into existing local-first systems.

🧑‍💻 Use Cases
Collaborative tools with offline and peer-to-peer capabilities

Federated publishing platforms and social apps

Custom apps that require secure, controlled data replication across instances

Local-first SaaS with optional cloud or edge sync

## 🚧 Status
Actively under development. Current milestones include:

Core federation engine: secure DAG-based sync

Selective sharing and subscription model

Authentication, record integrity, and conflict handling

Early developer documentation and CLI tooling
